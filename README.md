> "In 2018, the Chicago Board Options Exchange reported that over $1 quadrillion worth of options
were traded in the US.
"









ðŸ“Œ In this Project, we assumed the role of a quantitative analyst for using a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer investor one-stop online investment solution for their options part of portfolio.

Technical requirements for Project 2.

## Software Version Control (10 points)
-----------------Repository created on GitHub. (2 points)

-----------------Files frequently committed to repository. (3 points)

-----------------Commit messages with appropriate level of detail included. (2 points)

-----------------Repository organized, and relevant information and project files included. (3 points)

## Data Collection and Preparation (10 points)
-----------------Data collected from CSV files, APIs, or databases by using Python or a Python library. (5 points)

-----------------Data cleaned and prepared for the application or analysis by using Python or a Python library. (5 points)

### Libraries / interfaces
*  Pandas - is a software library designed for data analytics that makes it easier to work with data from practically any type of file. Pandas supplies powerful tools for working with time data in particular, and time is a key aspect of financial analysis. Analysts typically compare and measure financial assetsâ€”from single stocks to large portfoliosâ€”across time.
* With the combination of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, you can efficiently import, prepare, and analyze data of any type or quantity.
* Following libraries were used to analyze the data

```
# Import the required libraries and dependencies


```

* New libriry we used helped us to clean the warnings in the code


## Machine Learning (40 points)
Jupyter notebook and Google Colab used to prepare training and testing datasets. (5 points)

--------------------Following machine learning models created. (5 points)



--------------------We fit models to the training data. (5 points)

--------------------Trained models evaluated by using the testing data. Calculations, metrics, or visualizations that are needed to evaluate the performance included. (10 points)

--------------------Predictions shown by using a sample of new data. Predictions compared if more than one model was used. (3 points)

--------------------PNG images of your visualizations saved to distribute to the class and instructional team and to include in your presentation and the README.md file for your repo. (2 points)

--------------------One new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric used that the class hasn't already covered. (10 points)

## Documentation (15 points)

You can find Code in Jupyter Notebook  is well commented with concise, relevant notes. (5 points)

GitHub README.md file includes a concise project overview. (2 points)

### Project overview.




GitHub README.md file includes detailed usage and installation instructions. (3 points)




GitHub README.md file includes either examples of the application or the results and summary of the analysis. (5 points)

### Work with GitHub
* Repository created on GitHub
* Our group made sure that files  were frequently committed to repository
* Our repository is organized, and includes Resources folder with CSV  project files, 
*
* Detailed explanation of each step with explanation of financial data and conclusions of analyses (example)



## Presentation (25 points)

An executive summary of the project and project goals. (5 points)
## An executive summary

*For out second project we decided to take challenging, but most rewarding approach.
We are working on our passion project.


--------------------Explain how this project relates to fintech and machine learning.

We decided to use the power of Python and machine learning  to build a sophisticated algorithmic trading bot.Â 
Specifically, we would like to in depth explore option trading 

â€œOption contracts are a financial derivative that represents the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a particular security before expiration dateâ€¦..
â€¨Because of the huge diversity of historical options data and their relatively few applications, no open source dataset exists."
ï¿¼

--------------------The selected model. (5 points)

--------------------Describe the machine learning model that your group selected and why.
The data preparation and model training process. (3 points)

--------------------Describe the source of your data and why you chose it for your project.

--------------------Describe the collection, cleanup, and preparation process.

--------------------Describe the training process.

--------------------The approach that your group took to achieve the project goals. (5 points)






--------------------Include any relevant code or demonstrations of the machine learning model.

--------------------Describe the techniques that you used to evaluate the performance of the model.

--------------------Discuss any unanticipated insights or problems that arose and how you resolved them.

--------------------The results and conclusions from the machine learning model or application. (5 points)

--------------------Include relevant images or examples to support your work.

--------------------If the project goal wasnâ€™t achieved, share the issues and what the group tried for resolving them.

--------------------Next steps. (2 points)

--------------------Take a moment to discuss the potential next steps for the project.

--------------------Discuss any additional questions that youâ€™d explore if you had more time. Specifically, if you had additional weeks to work on your project, what would you research next?




### What is special about out project?

* Very well  commented code with deeply analyses and explained results for technical user lacking an understanding







### How to install

* Save remote repo from GitHub to your computer (Desktop): in Terninal type:

```
cd desktop

git clone https://github.com/
```

now you can find repo on your desktop


* Open a Jupyter Lab: In Terminal type command

```
jupyter lab
```

* In Jupyter Lab access saved repo folder 
* Choose [ .ipynb ] file to see the analysis report.






## Work with data

### Data Collection

* We used various skills learned in a bootcamp and various sources of date to collect information: data collected from CSV files, APIs, or databases by using Python or a Python library
* Source of data: 
* Imported data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
* API calls: 


### Cleanup & Analyse

* 
### Data visualization 
* The next step was to dive a bit more deeply into that data through visualizations.
* Some sets of data to analyses use a simple plot function, but for others included longer time period and overlaying data we included interactive visualizations to explore and uncover relationships and patterns in your data

### Results and summary of the analysis
